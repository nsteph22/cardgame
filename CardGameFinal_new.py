# Card Game Final Project â€“ INST126
# Author: Nahjah
# Description:
# This is a two-player card game (player vs. computer). Cards are shuffled and dealt, and players take turns
# playing cards by matching suit. Whoever plays the highest card in the suit wins the round.
# Advanced Features:
# - Uses time.sleep() to slow the game and make it feel more natural
# - Uses time.strftime() to print a timestamp for each round
# Resources:
# - time.sleep(): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3v7iMEzBtY
# - time.strftime(): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk7qqbZxJGo
